# Final Project
This page contains the deadlines and important deliverables for the Final Project. Please read the entire page in full. 

## Deliverables
- The primary deliverable for each stage of the project is the application you are building. Focus on working code and writing tests over presentation quality.
- All of your code should be pushed to your team's GitHub repository as frequently as possible and certainly before each check-in and the final deadline. 
- By April 12 each team should meet with one of the instructional team (Michael, Josh, or Nimo).  You should arrainge a meeting time  via DM on Slack.
- On April 19 there will be in-class demonstrations in which each team will give a demonstration of their application to the class. You may prepare 
slides for these check-in demonstrations if you choose, but the main goal is to demonstrate how users can use your application and show your code. 
- On April 28 and April 29 (the last two days of class), each team will give a longer demonstration and presentation about your project. Your presentation should explain the goals
of the project, how far you got toward achieving those goals, what challenges you faced, and what you would do next if you had more time. You should also demonstration your 
application and show off interesting bits of your code. You can prepare slides if you like for the final demonstration, but it is not required.  We will be asking for signups before that class.

## Deadlines
These are the important dates that you should note
- April 12th: have meet with an instrctor in order to discuss your progress; come prepared with your code and any questions you have.
- April 19th: demonstrate your current progress to the class.
- April 28th or 29th: present your final project code and slides to the class and answer questions from the instructors and your classmates. 

## Tips and Suggestions
- Make sure that you are setting your own deliverables and checkpoints in order to make sure you are staying on track and have enough time to complete all aspects of your project.
- Practice your demo before class.
