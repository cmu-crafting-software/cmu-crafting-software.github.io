# Homework 1 **Due Friday Jan 31st at 2pm EST**{: .label .label-red }

In this homework, you will be practicing using version control (`git` and [GitHub](https://github.com/)). We will be using this throughout the course extensively. Additionally, we will be requiring you to use the command line for this assignment.

## Learning goals

- Understand the basic concepts of Version Control Systems (VCS)
- Create a Github Account
- Perform basic VCS actions
- Understand the difference between `git` and GitHub
- Practice VCS commands necessary for turning in homeworks

## Tasks

You will be asked to perform the following series of tasks:

- Create a GitHub account
- Clone the HW1 repo
- Create a branch locally
- Learn to manage conflicts
- Push a branch to GitHub
- Make a change to the student list
- Open a Pull Request to the `main` branch

### Create a Github account

You should create a free [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account if you do not already have one.
If you have an existing GitHub account, you may use that.

### Clone HW1 repo

There is a very simple repo that has been set up for HW1. You can find it [here](https://github.com/cmu-crafting-software/homework01). You should clone the repo to a local directory on your machine. This should be done via the command line, and you should include the command(s) needed in your script to turn in.

### Create a branch locally

You should create a new branch of the repository, and you should name the branch with your Andrew ID as the name. This should be done via the command line, and you should include the command(s) needed in your script to turn in.

### Make a change to the student list, commit locally, and manage any conflicts that might arise

In the branch that you created, you should make a change to the `ClassRoster.md` file, adding your name and Andrew ID to the Class Roster. You should then commit that change to your local branch; please ensure you use a descriptive commit message!

A quick note about Git commit messages: technically you can write them any way you want, and there are a few different conventions out there, but _the most common_ convention is this:

- Typically just one line:
  - Start with a capital letter.
  - Write in the _imperative voice_: for instance, you'd write **"Fix bug"** and not ~~"Fixed bug"~~ or ~~"Fixes bug"~~.
  - No ending punctuation.
  - 50 characters or less.
- Commit messages _can_ have multiple lines but you probably won't use that in this class.

Please use this convention for your commit messages in this class.

Commiting should be done via the command line, and you should include the command(s) needed in your script to turn in.

### Push branch to GitHub

Once you have committed your change, you should push the change on the branch to the GitHub repository. This should be done via the command line, and you should include the command(s) needed in your script to turn in.

### Open a Pull Request to the main branch

Now that the commit is visible on the GitHub site, you should open a Pull Request from your personal branch, to the `main` branch. Again, don't forget to have a descriptive, convention-following message for the Pull Request. You do not need to do this via the command line, you may use the GitHub website for opening the pull request.

### Manage merge conflicts

Merge conflicts can be very annoying, and will be a cause of headaches for you. We want you to try and follow these steps to (artificially) create a merge conflict, so that you can resolve the merge conflict. Here are the steps to follow (replacing `[andrewID]` with your own Andrew ID):

- In the branch `[andrewID]`, create a text file called `student_facts.txt`
- In this file, write what year and college you are in.
- Commit this change and include a message about what you just did.
- Create a new branch called `new-[andrewID]` and switch to that branch.
- Open up `student_facts.txt` and delete the previous line you wrote and now only include a sentence about a fun fact about yourself.
- Commit this change and include a message about what you just did.
- Switch back to the branch `[andrewID]`.
- Open up `student_facts.txt` and append to this file a sentence about what programming languages and/or coding classes you have taken.
- Commit this change and include a message about what you just did.
- While in `[andrewID]`, merge this branch with `new-[andrewID]`.
- You will see that there are conflicts.
- To resolve these conflicts, open on the file `student_facts.txt` and edit the file such that there are three different lines with (and in this order):
  - A sentence about your year and major.
  - A sentence about what programming languages and/or coding classes you have taken.
  - A sentence with a fun fact about yourself.
  - Commit this change and include a message about what you just did.
- While in `[andrewID]`, create a file with all of the terminal commands you used so far.
  The appropriate steps here should be done via the command line, and you should include the command(s) needed in your script to turn in.

## Tips and Suggestions

We are requiring you to learn to use the command line interface for this assignment. However, if you find yourself struggling, you might want to try using the `git` client built into [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) first, then re-doing the assignment with the command line.

Writing a good commit message is hard! Don't feel bad if it takes a bit of thinking, or if you are not happy with your first version. You can use `git` to _amend_ a commit message even after you've already committed, as long as you haven't pushed yet.

One pro tip with `git`. It can often be the case that your local directory can get really messed up. Feel free to delete your local directory and start over. This is a common technique when working with `git`.

## Deadlines and Deliverables

**Due Date**: Friday Jan 31st at 2pm.
You may use up to two (2) late days, out of six total. To use a late day, simply message us on Slack to let us know that you will be using a late day.

**Deliverable**: For this assignment, you have two deliverables.
You will turn in a script that shows what commands you used at the command line. You should turn this in by sending it to both instructors and the TA in a group message via Slack.
Your commits to the repository will be viewable by us, and we will use them for grading (you might want to confirm that they are visible by using the GitHub web interface).

## Assignment Review

Because this is a new class, we are asking you to fill out a short survey to help us calibrate the homeworks. This survey is ungraded, but your input will be very valuable for us in improving the course both for this semester, and for future years.

## Grading

The total assignment is worth 100 points.

| Item                        | Points  |
